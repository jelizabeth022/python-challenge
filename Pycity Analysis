# PyCity Schools Analysis 
 
As the new Chief Data Scientist for the city's school district, I am helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. 
I was given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend.

Based on the aggregate data, I was able to draw two conclusions on the obvious trends in school performance. 
The school with the least number of students passing reading and math is Rodriguez High School at a rate of 52.988247%. 
Furthermore, the data demonstrates that students are performing higher in math and reading in Charter Schools compared to District Schools.
